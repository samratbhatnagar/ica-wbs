In some instances the latest version may not work, version 17.3 is known to deploy the package properly. You should also be aware that bacpac files exported from some SQL Server instances cannot be deployed to Azure SQL Servers. We have also included a .bak file of the Insurance database that you can use to restore from.

18. Select **Finish** and the database will deploy to Azure
